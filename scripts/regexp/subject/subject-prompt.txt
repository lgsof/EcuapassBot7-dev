Now, I want a python function to extractt from a string four elements: company name, document type and number, company address, and city with country. Take into account the following considerations for the extraction:
- The company name is always the first element
- The doc type and doc number are always the second element and they have the form given by the previous regular expression.
- The company address are always the third element, and
- The city and country are the last elements, and can be as the following strings:
    CARTAGENA COLOMBIA
    QUITO ECUADOR
    TULCAN, ECUADOR
    ANTIOQUIA - COLOMBIA
    QUITO - ECUADOR
- The countries are only three "COLOMBIA", "ECUADOR", and "PERU".
- The cities corresponds to the ones of the respective country.
